<h1>aidePhoneGap</h1>

Some quick templates so that one can use <a href=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aide.premium.key>AIDE</a> with a <a href=http://phonegap.com>PhoneGap</a> projekt.

A combination that means one can make Apps with just one's Android mobile...

<b>Note:</b>
BasicAIDEPhoneGap is without CSS: basic boring text display
The world of HTML5 is full of personal preferances, and you can add your to the template.
There is only a very basic 'div' replacement with text from what PhoneGap believes the device platform is (Android :) )

BasicAngularJSAIDEPhoneGap is also without much ...

BasicKitchenSink combines Jquery Mobile and AngularJS with a third component, an adapter  https://github.com/tigbro/jquery-mobile-angular-adapter Note that there is some doc one needs to read in order to sucessfully combine the two. Again, very basic

<h2>Get started ...</h2>

Start AIDE and checkout this git (https://github.com/OwenBrotherwood/aidePhoneGap.git)

"Run" in AIDE: navigate to the directory of interest that has the project

Change the file contents either in AIDE or copy this git and edit the files in your web browser direct from Github.

<b>Hint:</b>

I do a lot of the HTML5 stuff on my local machine occasionally commit back changes to Github so that I can test on a Droid.
