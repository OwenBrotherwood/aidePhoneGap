aidePhoneGap

Add html, css and JS after taste ...

Did you know one can edit files on a git repository @ github???

This means, to develope an Android app "on the fly":
you only need a webbrowser to edit files and an Android to show the app which has Android-Aide installed

Seeing is believing ...

POC
Create a Phone Gap project from command line.
Do some git with github to create a "template" for project
Compile on Android-AIDE :)

NOTE:
The version in master is without CSS and is therefor a template to add your taste off css

Get started ...

Start AIDE and checkout this git (https://github.com/OwenBrotherwood/aidePhoneGap.git)

"Run" in AIDE ...

Change the file contents either in AIDE or copy this git and edit the files in your web browser direct from Github.

Hint:

I do a lot of the HTML5 stuff on my local machine occasionally commit back changes to Github so that I can test on a Droid.
