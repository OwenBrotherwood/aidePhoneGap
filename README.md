aidePhoneGap

POC
Create a Phone Gap project from command line.
Do some git with github
Compile on Android-AIDE :)

Add html, css and JS after taste ...

Did you know one can edit files on a git repository @ github???

This means, to develope an Android app "on the fly":
you only need a webbrowser to edit files and an Android to show the app which has Android-Aide installed
