aidePhoneGap
============

A quick template so that one can use AIDE with a PhoneGap projekt.

NOTE:
The version in master is without CSS: basic boring text display
The world of HTML5 is full of personal preferances, and you can add your personal preferances after you have a basic template.

There is only a very basic <div> replacement with text from what PhoneGap believes the device platform is (Android :) )

Get started ...

Start AIDE and checkout this git (https://github.com/OwenBrotherwood/aidePhoneGap.git)

"Run" in AIDE ...

Change the file contents either in AIDE or copy this git and edit the files in your web browser direct from Github.

Hint:

I do a lot of the HTML5 stuff on my local machine occasionally commit back changes to Github so that I can test on a Droid.
